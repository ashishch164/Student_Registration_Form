1. First of all download php files and images from this repository's admin,staff,customer and img folder and store them in one file folder ,lets called it as "RRS" and do not create any folders in it like admin,customer,img or staff. I created in repo only just to look well managed. </br></br>
2. Install xampp server in your computer and then in htdocs folder in xampp folder, paste this whole RRS folder. </br>
3. Then start your xampp server from xampp control panel. </br>
4. After that open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser and create a new database and named it as "DB" (Remember: it must be in capital form).</br>
5. Then create 7 tables and named it as "admin", "customer","staff","login","pnr","train","history".(Remember:this must be in small letters and do not add quotes in it,that quotes  is just to mention table names properly and same applies for "DB" also).</br>

Note: photos is small in size,idk why this happened, so to view full image, click on download button 
6. Here your database will look like:</br>

pnr-> https://github.com/ashishch164/WebDev_Projects/blob/master/Railway%20Reservation%20System/database%20photos/New%20Picture%20(94).jpg        In this once you are created this table,make sure to enter 10000 as first pnr value int, otherise ticket booking will not succeeded and user will not be able to view his/her pnr no.</br>
staff-> https://github.com/ashishch164/WebDev_Projects/blob/master/Railway%20Reservation%20System/database%20photos/New%20Picture%20(95).jpg </br>
train-> https://github.com/ashishch164/WebDev_Projects/blob/master/Railway%20Reservation%20System/database%20photos/New%20Picture%20(96).jpg</br>
 
Note:Please enter details manually in all the tables in the database according to your choice before executing software. 

7. And last just provide the URL of your project folder in your browser like http://localhost/RRS/index.php   </br> (Note: RRS is folder name and index.php is file name)
This will take you to the customer login page and same case for admin and staff also.
8. Now Run software.
